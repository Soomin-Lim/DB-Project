## 프로젝트 설명
Electronics Vendor 회사의 DBA가 되어 DB를 설계하는 프로젝트

The application is an electronics vendor that operates both a Web site and a chain
of many physical stores. Examples include Best Buy and Circuit City. To find out more about
this application, think about any experiences you may have had making purchases both
online and in-store, and browse their Web sites.
In our hypothetical company, it has been decided to redesign a major part of the
database that underlies company operations. Unfortunately, the manager assigned to solicit
database design proposals is not very computer literate and is unable to provide a very
detailed specification at the technical level.
